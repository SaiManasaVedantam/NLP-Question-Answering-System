This Project is divided into 4 major tasks as follows:

1. NLP PIPELINE FOR FEATURE EXTRACTION
	In this step, we extract the following features on the articles:
	a. Sentence Tokenization
	b. Word Tokenization
	c. Lemmatization
	d. Part-of-Speech(POS) Tagging
	e. Dependency Parsing
	f. Synonym, Hypernym, Meronym, Holonym & Hyponym extraction using WordNet
	g. Obtain heads for each sentence in the corpus.

2. IMPLEMENTATION OF QUESTION-ANSWERING(QA) SYSTEM
	In this step, we use ElasticSearch to index files based on the word occurrences. We use the similar architecture on the Query string also.
