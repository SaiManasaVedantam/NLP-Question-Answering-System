      "------SENTENCE------\n",
      "Even the \"highly observant\" Gilbert White, in his posthumously published 1789 The Natural History of Selborne, quoted a man's story about swallows being found in a chalk cliff collapse \"while he was a schoolboy at Brighthelmstone\", though the man denied being an eyewitness.\n",

      "------SENTENCE------\n",
      "However, he also writes that \"as to swallows being found in a torpid state during the winter in the Isle of Wight or any part of this country, I never heard any such account worth attending to\", and that if early swallows \"happen to find frost and snow they immediately withdraw for a time—a circumstance this much more in favour of hiding than migration\", since he doubts they would \"return for a week or two to warmer latitudes\".\n",

      "Thomas Bewick's A History of British Birds (Volume 1, 1797) mentions a report from \"a very intelligent master of a vessel\" who, \"between the islands of Minorca and Majorca, saw great numbers of Swallows flying northward\", and states the situation in Britain as follows: Bewick then describes an experiment which succeeded in keeping swallows alive in Britain for several years, where they remained warm and dry through the winters.\n",

      "The most common pattern involves flying north in the spring to breed in the temperate or Arctic summer and returning in the autumn to wintering grounds in warmer regions to the south.\n",
      "\n",
      "------SENTENCE------\n",
      "Of course, in the southern hemisphere the directions are reversed, but there is less land area in the far south to support long-distance migration.\n",
      "\n",
      "------SENTENCE------\n",
      "The primary motivation for migration appears to be food; for example, some hummingbirds choose not to migrate if fed through the winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "------SENTENCE------\n",
      "Also, the longer days of the northern summer provide extended time for breeding birds to feed their young.\n",

      "\n",
      "------SENTENCE------\n",
      "Predation can be heightened during migration: Eleonora's falcon Falco eleonorae, which breeds on Mediterranean islands, has a very late breeding season, coordinated with the autumn passage of southbound passerine migrants, which it feeds to its young.\n",

      "Within a species not all populations may be migratory; this is known as \"partial migration\".\n",
      "\n",
      "------SENTENCE------\n",
      "Partial migration is very common in the southern continents; in Australia, 44% of non-passerine birds and 32% of passerine species are partially migratory.\n",
      "\n",
      "------SENTENCE------\n",
      "In some species, the population at higher latitudes tends to be migratory and will often winter at lower latitude.\n",

      "This is an example of leap-frog migration.\n",
      "\n",
      "------SENTENCE------\n",
      "Many fully migratory species show leap-frog migration (birds that nest at higher latitudes spend the winter at lower latitudes), and many show the alternative, chain migration, where populations 'slide' more evenly north and south without reversing order.\n",
